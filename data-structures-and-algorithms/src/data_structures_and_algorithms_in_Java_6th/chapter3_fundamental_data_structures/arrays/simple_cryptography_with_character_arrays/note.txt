1. Simple Cryptography with character arrays:
- An important application of character arrays and string is CRYPTOGRAPHY, which is the science of secret message.
- Process of encryption, in which is message, called the PLAINTEXT, is converted into a scrambled message,
called the CIPHERTEXT.
- Earliest encryption scheme is the Caesar cipher, is simple way to obscure(không rõ ràng) message witten in a language
that forms words with alphabet.

2. Converting between strings and character arrays:
3. Using character arrays as replacement codes:
- If we were to number our letters like array indices, so that A is 0, B is 1, C is 2, then
  we can represent the replacement rule as a character array, encoder, such that A is
  mapped to encoder[0], B is mapped to encoder[1], and so on
- Then, in order to find a replacement for a character in our Caesar cipher, we need to map the characters
  from A to Z to the respective numbers from 0 to 25
- The process of decrypting the message can be implemented by simply using
  a different character array to represent the replacement rule—one that effectively
  shifts characters in the opposite direction.
